# Copilot Instructions for Lexpin-Test

## Project Overview
- **Type:** Personal frontend practice project
- **Goal:** Build a landing page using HTML5 and CSS3 only (no frameworks or JavaScript currently in use).
- **Status:** In development

## Key Files & Structure
- `index.html`: Main entry point for the landing page.
- `docs/README.md`: Project description, tech stack, and structure notes.
- `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: PR conventions and workflow.
- (Planned) `src/` directory for components, styles, and assets (not present yet).

## Developer Workflow
- **Cloning:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KevDeveloperfront/Lexpin-Test.git
  ```
- **Development:**
  - Edit `index.html` directly for now.
  - No build step required; open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
- **Testing:**
  - No automated tests yet. Manual browser testing only.
- **PR Workflow:**
  - Use the template in `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for all PRs.
  - Example dev command (for future use): `npm run dev` (not currently available).

## Conventions & Patterns
- **HTML/CSS only:** No JavaScript or frameworks in use.
- **Docs:** All documentation is in the `docs/` folder.
- **Future Structure:**
  - `src/components/` for reusable HTML snippets
  - `src/styles/` for CSS
  - `src/assets/` for images/icons
- **Language:** Spanish is used in documentation and PR templates.

## Integration & External Dependencies
- No external dependencies or build tools currently configured.
- Deployment may use Vercel in the future (see README).

## Examples
- To add a new section, edit `index.html` directly.
- To update documentation, edit files in `docs/`.

## TODOs
- Add `src/` directory and migrate code as project grows.
- Add automated tests and build scripts if/when needed.
